CA
- General
	- Adjust your burst to the arm times. Arms are not about dps, but burst. Golem rotation goes out the window if you only have 8 seconds to do damage (kinda same as on Adina hands).
- Chrono (Sophie)
	- Toughness gear? Lower dps than druid somehow
	- If you don't have TW, probably not worth using F4
- pBS (EcS)
	- Sword usage *massively* delayed. Generally, use as soon as you have 10 stacks, unless there is a specific reason to hold them.
	- When coming back from collecting, already can slap the boss (easiest is to just use Axe 5 in his face while running back)
	- All collection phases are the same, last one is just more dangerous as there is an arm and usually also trashmobs interfering
	- Don't waste berserk mode if boss is about to phase/don't delay berserk when coming back to boss. After first collecting, you just auto for quite a while before berserk; then berserk runs out right after we phase, which means you don't have it for the arm.
	- You only entered berserk twice in the entire fight; after 50%, no berserk ever. Don't know what you were waiting for. That's why Ventari alac had more dps overall.
- Druid (Zanakin)
	- No CA used on the first arm - as soon as we are in combat, wh5 and then CA. Everything else after. People had no might for the entire first arm burn.
	- No need to focus on swords when going to boss anymore - they will eventually come to stack anyway and get cleaved down.
- pDD (Attila)
	- Try to steal some bombs from the shields, helps with CCing them significantly
	- Don't bother with basi, unless you use it specifically for the shields. It will most likely get eaten by the arm anyway, and you timed it WAAAY to early for it to do anything.
- pHolo (Dex)
	- Laser disk is way too delayed on the arm. E.g. very first arm phase, for ~4 ticks of the disk, the arm is already back up again. Same with ult. Try to adapt rotation to get more burst out of it. Also laser disk F skill. If you know you will lose a few ticks, just hold them until the arm comes down again.
	- Don't overfocus on giving arms vuln. F3 alone will already do enough.
	- Smart to go off stack to grab swords that were lying around. On the very last phase, just keep them, as there is a chance that shield runner gets fucked by shields in their path, to emergency break CAs bubble.
	
Largos pre
- General
	- Don't chase after a thing that has to run around anyway. Stack up to get boons and heals.
	- Do not interfere with pulls. That means simply don't use any ability that has build-in CC, like renegade stun cat etc.
	- If shit is bad on shark, either rezz or CC. Anything else doesn't matter.
- pDD (Narkane)
	- Can take scorpion wire for pulls
	- Stealth heal for additional CC on shark/use FF=>PS on shark to CC as well; or even SB4 if nothing else available
- Healers (Zanakin/EcS)
	- Relog to heal immediately after CA is dead
	
Largos
- General
	- Dashes on last platform have highest priority. No amount of dps is worth getting hit by that.
- cRen (Narkane)
	- Don't facetank dashes, just dodge. The crit chance mod is not worth getting cold/slow on you, or potentially going down.
	- Just use a stun cat for CC instead of a vuln cat. Squad dps loss by having that CC bar up forever is not worth the personal dps. (on the first break. on the last didnt have energy)
- cele FB tank (Dex)
	- When multiple people downed at 30%, try to use F2 for heaing and maybe also F3 for stab so people can rezz through the explosion
- Druid (Zanakin)
	- You realized it yourself, but yeah => rezz spirit active can save a lot
- hTemp (EcS)
	- Your 6 is your only big emergency heal; do not waste it (e.g. wasted at 150s, then dashes killed people couple seconds later
	- See rotation notes on Sabir
- SCAMs (Zerka, Quaggan)
	- You always have F3 and staff 5 available for CC. Use 3 right before F3 to replenish clones after. Can also use heal in a pinch if you have it. But F3 and Staff5 is the absolute minimum and expected.
	- Note that you can always use ult, even if floating or being knocked back. So you can use it to counteract the knock, or get yourself out of a dash if needed. In an emergency, can also use midnight signet as stunbreak.
	- Also with two staff mirages on each side now, feel free to use dps consumables.
	
Q1
- pDD (Zerka/Cy)
	- After using venom, the VERY NEXT HIT YOU LAND (or the ally affected by it)  will use the venom, no matter if there is a breakbar or not. On the failed hydra, Cy used it to early (got consumed before breakbar was available), Zerka used it too late (meteors were already falling). You have two options - use the pre-stolen bombs to CC, or actually time your Venom correctly. Wait out the two autos, then as soon as the hydra goes into the animation for starting CC, use venom.
	- On the kill run, both venoms were used too early. Of the potential 9 stacks (1 gets lost due to overlap because both DDs are same sub), only 1 actually got used, because Cy himself delayed his attack by dodging off stack.
	- On the second Q1 phase (after destroyer), use one bomb to pull the left side elemental closer - do NOT toss the bomb center mass on him, because that will keep him in place there. Clip him with the edge of the hitbox, to get as much pull range out of it as possible.
	- In the lamp, use first bomb in the ghost room (third group of enemies), second bomb in the molten room (fourth group). Those mobs tend to spread out, bombs keep them together.
	- Prestack basi venom on destroyer (meaning cast it way before he spawns). There is no way the stack(s) are eaten by something else as there is nothing else to attack. It stays on for 30s, so no worries about being too early there.
	- As soon as the little destroyers are in range, dump 2 bombs on them (make sure you hit all 3 of them), steal from destroyer, and use those bombs the same way. Cleaving down those small ones is important. Try to conserve the next two bombs you get from the destroyer for your opener on Qadim himself (you will have basi for the second CC bar).
	- Use the skill stolen from the Hydra to speed up pyre
- hTemp (EcS)
	- When going to a pylon, 2 => overload fire immediately when you reach the pylon. Take portal back once you are at or close to 25 stacks; then potentially use 5 => 2 on stack. As soon as all 10 people are on stack, Aftershock => Fire4 => Swap water (filler) => Swap earth for earth 4, w/e else filler (Sc2 good here) then overload earth as soon as possible; short dips into air and water before doing the loop over. Consider rebound if the situation is messy for shockwave. The point is - YOU need to be at 25 stacks of might when you get to Q1, so you can immediately share that with Fire4 to all 10 people. If you first have to overload fire, we get delayed and you also delay healing etc.
	- Fire overload does NOTHING for ANYONE but yourself (not technically true, but try to think of it that way). Fire overload (and blast finishers) are a way to give yourself 25 stacks of might. The only thing giving allies might is Fire4 (again not technically true). But what it means is that Fire overload is something to precast before the actual dps phase starts, not something to be done during the dps phase unless it can't be avoided.
	- BD enhancement, that should be healing output enhancement instead, as you should be capped on BD already with gear (if you are running SC build; if you are running the actually correct build, you would be 4.7% under cap, but then just remind me to put down heal food.). The heal enhancement is quite significant in its effect.
	- Aftershock needs to be very soon after we have all 10 people at Q1 (basically, as soon as they pop out of the portal), as Q1 hits like a truck, and protection is vital to mitigate that
	- Opener at the very beginning can be faster; your Fire4 should pop right before Attila leaves stack. Since it was delayed, lamp person had basically no might. Same thing also happens on the second lamp.
	- In the third lamp, no might was had at all - why? Already overload fire before lamp pops; if you don't have it, overload it while walking with the group and at least give some might. You fire AAd throughout the entire lamp3 phase - your purpose down there is boons and healing (and earth5 in the giants room if it lines up).
- pBS (Narkane)
	- For CC, always Mace3=>Mace5, not the other way around (Mace5 has a really long animatio, that is easy to accidentally cancel - happened at least twice)
- DivAlac (Quaggan)
	- Good stability usage throughout
- pSlb (Zanakin)
	- You do not need to provide any CC on wyvern, unless asked to - focus on opening lamp as soon as the call comes
	- Be on longbow when the call for lamp comes (all phases); you can roughly estimate it based on the lamp persons position on the map
- hFB
	- Forget F1 exists, condi signet share is worthless here
	- Random staff5 in the opener again - is that a missclick, or are you actually trying to do something with that?
	- As soon as you get to the pyre platform, staff 3 (for upkeep healing) and then staff 4 to make sure people have decent might when they come back to Q1. When back at Q1, use any symbol, and then F3=>5+4 for aegis/toughness/stab just for general suvivability. Feel like you are not using symbols off cooldown on Q1, really make sure that whenever a symbol is available, immediately use it for the tick heal.
